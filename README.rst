Introduction
============

The email messages that GroupServer_ sends from a group are
different from what is received. This product supplies the code
for representing a post_.

Post
====

The ``gs.group.list.email.text.Post`` class takes a ``messages``
folder, the group info, and a post-identifier and returns a
representation of a post that conforms with the
``gs.group.list.email.text.interfaces.IPost`` interface.

.. code-block:: python

  post = Post(groupInfo.groupObj.messages, groupInfo, postId)

This post is then adapted into a message_.

Message
-------

A text version of a message is generated by using a *named
adaptor.* The post and request are adapted with the name ``text``
requested.

.. code-block:: python

  page = getMultiAdapter((post, request), name='text')
  textBody = page()

For testing this adaption and rendering is done automatically by
the ``gs-group-list-email`` traversal. It takes the
post-identifier off the URL and returns a rendered page:
<http://groupserver.org/groups/development/messages/gs-group-list-email/N5o9zxaSkSYFQBB45HqHV>
